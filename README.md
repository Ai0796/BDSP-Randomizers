# Pokemon Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl Randomizer by Aldo796, Copycat, SanGawku, and XLuma

# Required Files

Right now our randomizer has 4 required files:
- masterdatas
- personal_masterdatas
- gamesettings
- UgData

You can get those files by dumping your cartridge via tools such as [NXDumpTool](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool)

# Usage

- Extract the archive into a directory with the romfs folder from Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl
- Run main.exe and select your randomization settings
- Once finished it will automatically create a Data folder in your romfs folder that contains the mod. After that, install like a standard switch mod
